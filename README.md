## Building from source
1. Install the necessary dependencies

    [Rust](https://rustup.rs)
    
        ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
        ```

    [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) - Documentation framework
    
        ```bash
        cargo install mdbook
        ```

    [mdBook-admonish](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish) - Admonitions plugin
    
        ```bash
        cargo install mdbook-admonish
        ```

        ```bash
        cargo install mdbook-i18n
        ```


1. Clone the repo and change into its directory
    
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:kn0wmad/mdbook-docs
    cd mdbook-docs
    ```
    
1. Serve and view a live, local version of the docs while editing
    
    ```bash
    mdbook serve --open
