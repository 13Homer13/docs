## Building from source
1. Install the necessary dependencies
    - [Rust](https://rustup.rs)
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

    - [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)
    ```bash
    cargo install mdbook
    ```

1. Clone the repo and change into its directory
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:kn0wmad/mdbook-docs
    cd mdbook-docs
    ```
    
1. Serve and view a live, local version of the docs while editing
    ```bash
    mdbook serve --open
    ```
    This will automatically open your default web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
