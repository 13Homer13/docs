## From a Pi with External Drive

Use this section if your current StartOS Raspberry Pi uses an external drive over USB.

1. Stop every service on your Raspberry Pi server.

1. Shutdown your Raspberry Pi server and disconnect from power.

1. Connect your new server to power and ethernet.

1. Visit http://start.local on any computer on the same LAN.

1. Connect your previous storage drive to any USB-3 or USB-C port on your new server.

1. Select "Recover".

1. Select "Transfer".

1. On the "Transfer" screen, select the previous external storage drive.

1. On the "Select Storage Drive" screen, select your new storage drive. This is the internal drive of the new server.

1. Create a password for the new server. It can be the same as before.

1. Your data will now transfer. This can take minutes to hours, depending on how much data you have.

1. If you intend to re-purpose the Raspberry Pi as another StartOS server, _be sure to first re-flash the microSD, then perform a fresh setup_, which will wipe the SSD in the process. It is a good idea to wipe the SSD separately beforehand, just in case.

   ```admonish warning

   _Do not_ power on the Raspberry Pi until you have successfully re-flashed the microSD. If you power it on as-is, it can cause serious problems, including loss of funds if you are running a lightning node.

1. Stop every service on your NASPi server. _Do not_ power it down.

1. Disconnect the USB adapter.

1. The two servers are now tethered together, and the NASPi is still running with all services stopped.

1. Connect your new server to power and ethernet if not already.

1. Visit http://start.local on any computer on the same LAN.

1. Select "Recover".

1. Select "Transfer".

1. On the "Transfer" screen, Select the NASPi storage drive.

1. On the "Select Storage Drive" screen, select your new storage drive. This is the internal drive of the new server.

1. Create a password for the new server. It can be the same as before.

1. Your data will now transfer. This can take minutes to hours, depending on how much data you have.

1. If you intend to re-purpose the NASPi as another StartOS server, _be sure to first re-flash the microSD, then perform a fresh setup_, which will wipe the SSD in the process.
