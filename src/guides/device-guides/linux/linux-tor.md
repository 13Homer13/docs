## Debian

This should work for most Debian-based systems, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, PopOS etc.

The following install is for the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Tor from Debian. If you would like the latest stable release, the Tor Project maintains their own Debian repository. The instructions to connect to this can be found <a href="https://support.torproject.org/apt/tor-deb-repo/" target="_blank">here</a>.

1.  Open a terminal and install Tor:

        sudo apt update && sudo apt install tor

<!-- @TODO do we need to start Tor? -->

    ```admonish tip

    Confirm that Tor is running:

        systemctl status tor

    In the rare event that Tor is having connectivity issues, reset the connection:

        sudo systemctl restart tor
    ```

## Arch / Garuda / Manjaro

1.  Open a terminal and install Tor:

        sudo pacman -S tor

<!-- @TODO do we need to start Tor? -->

    ```admonish tip

    Confirm that Tor is running:

        systemctl status tor

    In the rare event that Tor is having connectivity issues, reset the connection:

        sudo systemctl restart tor
    ```

## CentOS / Fedora / RHEL

1.  Configure the Tor Package repository. Add the following to `/etc/yum.repos.d/tor.repo`:

        [Tor]
        name=Tor for Enterprise Linux $releasever - $basearch
        baseurl=https://rpm.torproject.org/centos/$releasever/$basearch
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=https://rpm.torproject.org/centos/public_gpg.key
        cost=100

    For Fedora, the "name" line should be `Tor for Fedora $releasever - $basearch`

1.  Open a terminal and install Tor:

        sudo dnf install tor

1.  Enable tor service:

        sudo systemctl enable --now tor
