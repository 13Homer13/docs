## Prerequisites
Most modern routers have VPN functionality built-in. You'll need to configure your router to assign a static IP to your Start9 server and to setup a OpenVPN or WireGuard server on your router, depending on which it supports.

## OpenVPN

Slightly slower, but with more authentication options, including creation of individual users with passwords.

## WireGuard

Simpler and faster, its limitation is that it authenticates with keys rather than usernames and passwords (which might be easier to distribute to family/friends or others you share access to). You would create a WireGuard profile on your router's WireGuard Server for each device you want to connect to the VPN and follow the guide below on each device, importing the profile you created for that device.
