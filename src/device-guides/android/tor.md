1. In **Android settings**, go to `Settings > Network & Internet > Advanced > Private DNS` and toggle Private DNS to "off".

## Connecting Apps

Apps with Socks5 support can use Orbot as-is; there is no need to add them to the list of "VPN apps" in Orbot. Other apps, however, must to be added. Check the instructions for your app.

1. In Orbot, click "Choose Apps" and select the apps you want to utilize Tor.
