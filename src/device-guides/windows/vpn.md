## Prerequisites
Most modern routers have VPN functionality built-in. You'll need to configure your router to assign a static IP to your Start9 server and to setup a OpenVPN or Wireguard server on your router, depending on which it supports.

## OpenVPN

Slightly slower, but with more authentication options, including individual users.

### Automatic
### Manual


## Wireguard

Simpler and faster, its limitation is that it only authenticates with keys rather than usernames and passwords.
