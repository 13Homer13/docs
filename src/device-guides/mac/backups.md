## Create a Shared Folder

1. Identify or create a folder to store your server backups.

   ```admonish tip

    This folder can be located on an external drive connected to your Mac.
   ```

1. Go to `System Settings > General > Sharing` and click the "info" icon:

    <!-- @TODO -->

   ![Sharing](./assets/backups-sharing.png)

1. Click the toggle to enable file sharing, then click the "plus" icon and select your backups folder.

    <!-- @TODO -->

   ![Sharing info](./assets/backups-sharing-info.png)

1. Click "Options".

1. Select the user who owns the folder.

## Create a Backup

1.  In StartOS, go to `System > Create Backup`.

1.  Click "Open New".

1.  Complete the form:

    1.  **Hostname**: The name of your Mac. Check the tip in Step 8 of the section above to find it. On some versions of Mac, you may need to open up Terminal and type `hostname`.

    1.  **Path** - The _name_ of your shared folder, _not_ the full directory path.

    1.  **Username** - Your Mac user who owns the shared folder.

    1.  **Password** - Your password for the above user.

1.  Click "Connect".

    ```admonish warning title="Troubleshooting"

    - If you receive `Filesystem I/O Error mount error(13): Permission denied`, ensure you have entered all the correct values in the form. The hostname can be particularly tricky.

    - **MacOS Catalina (version 10.15.7)** If the backup fails, please see this <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253970425" target="_blank">Apple support thread</a>. If the provided solution does not work, you will either need to update your Mac or use a physical drive for backups.

    - **MacOS Ventura (version 13.2)** If you recently updated to Ventura, and you cannot get the folder to connect, do the following: in `System Settings > General > Sharing`, turn off file sharing, restart your mac, then turn file sharing back on.
    ```
