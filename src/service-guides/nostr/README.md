# Nostr

Nostr, short for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays," is a decentralized protocol designed for creating a censorship-resistant social media platform. It allows users to publish and share messages, known as "notes," to relays without relying on a central authority. This architecture promotes self-sovereignty and freedom of expression, as puplished content and user profiles are not easily subject to censorship or control by any single entity.
