1. Choose how to setup your relays and create a new account or access an existing account by using a nip-07 browser extension. If creating a new account, be sure to securely back up the private key, preferably using Vaultwarden on StartOS.

1. To connect to your own private relay, go to Relays -> App Relays, paste in your Nostr Relay Websocket URL (e.g. ws://address.onion) and click add. You can find this value in the Properties section of your Nostr RS Relay service.  

    ```admonish note

    If you plan to connect to your own private relay, you must use [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/) or [run Tor](/user-manual/connecting-remotely.md) on your system.  We recommend using Firefox which must be [configured to use Tor](/misc-guides/firefox-guides/tor.md).  
    It is recommended to use your Relay's Tor websocket URL (ws://address.onion), since the LAN websocket URL (wss://address.local) will only work when you are home.

    ```

1. To connect to your LND instance using [NWC](https://marketplace.start9.com/marketplace/nostr-wallet-connect) (Nostr Wallet Connect) for LN payments, go to Settings -> Lightning -> Connect wallet. Choose NWC and paste your pairing secret.
