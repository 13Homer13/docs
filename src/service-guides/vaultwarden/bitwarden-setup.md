# Bitwarden Client Setup

Here you can learn how to setup your various devices and browsers to be able to access your Vaultwarden service.

We suggest you connect to Vaultwarden over [VPN or Tor](/user-manual/connecting-remotely.md) for the best experienceâ€¦ an experience where you can access synced passwords **away from home** as well as create and save new passwords. Over LAN your app and all your passwords will be cached and available after an initial sync when not connected to your Start9 Server but you would later need to connect via LAN to add or update passwords in your vault.

## Browser Extension

```admonish tip

If you intend on connecting via **Tor** (i.e using the .onion address) rather than VPN the Bitwarden browser extension will only work with a Tor enabled browser.

If you choose **Firefox with Tor**, you will need to [follow this guide](/misc-guides/firefox-guides/tor.md) to run Tor on your device and configure Firefox to use it. If using **Brave** you will just need to [setup Tor on your device](/src/user-manual/connecting-remotely.md#connecting-over-tor). With Tor Browser, everything will just work right out of the box.

We recommend using Firefox as it is the most compatible browser with Start9 Servers.

```

1. In this example we will use Firefox, though these instructions will work just the same for Brave. First, install the [Bitwarden browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/).  

1. Head to the "Interfaces" tab in the Vaultwarden service on your Start9 Server:

    ![vaultwarden-interfaces](./assets/vaultwarden-interfaces.png)


1. Copy the preferred interface address for VPN/LAN or Tor:

    ![vaultwarden-interface-address](./assets/vaultwarden-interface-addresses.png)


1. Now head to the Bitwarden extension and click the "Region" dropdown menu and choose self-hosted. Under **Self-hosted environment** you will see a field for **Server URL**.

1. Now you need to grab the address of your Vaultwarden server. Paste the address into your extension and click "Save".

1. Now enter your credentials and the Bitwarden extension will be logged into your self-hosted Vaultwarden server!

You may need to hit the refresh button in the top left to get it to populate.
