# Jellyfin

Jellyfin has numerous other [clients](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/), not all of which have been tested at the time of writing. If you are able to test (successfully or unsucessfully) an app not documented in this guide, your feedback would be much appreciated.

## Swiftfin Apple tvOS

First you need to install and trust a StartOS root CA certificate on your Apple TV for secure local HTTPS connections.

1. On your Apple TV, go to Settings > General > Profiles.

2. Choose "Add Profile" and enter your URL: `http://[YOUR SERVER IP]/static/local-root-ca.crt`

3. Complete the prompts to install the certificate.

4. Then go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings, find your new certificate, and set it to `Trusted`.

Now download [Swiftfin](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swiftfin/id1604098728?platform=appleTV) client on your tvOS from appstore.

1. Upon opening the client, you will be prompted to add server. Click `Connect`.

2. Next you will be prompted for a server address; paste the URL (`.local` recommended) from Jellyfin service interfaces (`Services -> Jellyfin -> Interfaces`) and click `Connect`.

3. Next enter your username and password and click `Connect`.

```admonish tip

Some clients such as 'Jellyfin for Roku', 'Swiftfin' (tvOS) and other Samsung/LG Smart TV apps previously would not run as they were unable to resolve private urls like ``.local``. These should now work using your unique adjective-noun.local and port number found under `Services -> Jellyfin -> Interfaces`, or of course, the IP address and port.
