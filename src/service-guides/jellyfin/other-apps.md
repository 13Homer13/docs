# Jellyfin

Jellyfin has numerous other [clients](https://jellyfin.org/downloads/), not all of which have been tested at the time of writing. If you are able to test (successfully or unsucessfully) an app not documented in this guide, your feedback would be much appreciated.


```admonish tip

Some clients such as 'Jellyfin for Roku', 'Swiftfin' (tvOS) and other Samsung/LG Smart TV apps previously would not run as they were unable to resolve private urls like ``.local``. These should now work using your unique adjective-noun.local and port number found under `Services -> Jellyfin -> Interfaces`, or of course, the IP address and port.
