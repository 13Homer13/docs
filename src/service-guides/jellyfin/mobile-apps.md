## Android

Before proceeding, make sure your Android device has been setup to [connect over LAN](/user-manual/connecting-locally.md). If you are connecting remotely, you will need to connect over a [router VPN](/user-manual/connecting-remotely/vpn.md) or [setup Tor](/user-manual/connecting-remotely/tor.md).

1. Visit the app store of your choice and download the [Jellyfin Android app](https://jellyfin.org/downloads).

1. Open the app, you will be prompted for a host; paste the URL (`.local` recommended) from your Jellyfin service `Services -> Jellyfin -> Interfaces` in this field.

1. Next enter your username and password and tap "Sign In".

If you are getting connection errors, make sure you are connected to the same LAN and an external VPN is not blocking use on your device.
