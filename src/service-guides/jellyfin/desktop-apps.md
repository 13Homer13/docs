You can access Jellyfin and play your media through a [web browser](./web-application.md) if you prefer, rather than install an app.

```

**Instructions**

## MacOS or Windows
Before proceeding, make sure your device has been setup to [connect over LAN](/user-manual/connecting-locally.md). If you are connecting remotely, you will need to connect over a [router VPN](/user-manual/connecting-remotely.md) or [setup Tor](/src/user-manual/connecting-remotely.md).

1. Download the .dmg file (MacOS) or the .exe file (Windows) for [Jellyfin Media Player](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player/releases).

1. Upon opening the client, you will be prompted to add server. Click "Add Server".

1. Next you will be prompted for a server address; paste the URL (``.local`` recommended) from Jellyfin service interfaces (`Services -> Jellyfin -> Interfaces`) and click "Connect".

1. Next enter your username and password and click "Sign In".
