# Nextcloud

Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted cloud platform that allows you to store, share, and manage files securely from your own server or device. It's a private alternative to popular commercial "cloud" services (the "cloud" is just someone else's server), where you control your data instead of relying on third-parties. 

With Nextcloud, you can sync files across devices, collaborate on documents in real-time, and even integrate apps for tasks like video conferencing, calendar management, or note-taking. Itâ€™s highly customizable, privacy-focused, and ideal for individuals, businesses, or organizations looking to maintain full ownership of their digital assets while enjoying the convenience of cloud storage.
