# Nextcloud Calendar

[Nextcloud Calendar](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/calendar) is software for managing and syncing calendars, events, and tasks between your devices.  First set up your [client devices](/service-guides/nextcloud/nextcloud-setup/), so that Nextcloud will automatically keep your calendars synced.

Integrations available for:

- Mobile
    - Android
    - iOS

- Desktop
    - Linux
    - Mac
    - Windows

## NC App Setup

1. On the latest Start9 Nextcloud service, Calendar is included by default.  If coming from an older install, begin by downloading Calendar from your Nextcloud service's App Store (Top-right menu -> Apps).

    ```admonish tip
    
    Use the "Search" function to quickly find the App you are looking for

    ```

1. Once installed/enabled, you will get a new icon in your top menu for "Calendar."  Click it to get started.

    - At this point you can begin using the Calendar right away in the web UI.  All changes will be reflected in any currently synced client devices, or on any added in future.

## Client Integrations

Client integrations can all be found in the [initial setup guides](/service-guides/nextcloud/nextcloud-setup/) for your device.
