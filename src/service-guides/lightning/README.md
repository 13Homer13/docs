# Lightning Network

**Contents**

## Getting Started

- [Opening Your First Channel](./opening-channels.md) - We use Ride The Lightning (RTL) as the graphical interface to fund our CLN or LND wallet and open a private channel to Start9

- [Getting Inbound Liquidity](./getting-inbound-liquidity.md) - We look at the common ways to receive payments having only just opened a channel with all the liquidity on your side


## Connecting to CLN

- [Connect Directly to Core Lightning](./cln/) - Core Lightning is one of the two lightning implementations found on StartOS. It was created and is maintained by [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/).
    - [Alby](./cln/alby.md)
    - [Ride the Lightning](./cln/rtl.md)
    - [Zeus](./cln/zeus.md)


## Connecting to LND

- [Connect Directly to LND](./lnd/) - Core Lightning is the second of the two lightning implementations found on StartOS. It was created and is maintained by [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering/).

    - [RTL](service-guides/lightning/lnd/rtl.md)
    - [Zeus](service-guides/lightning/lnd/zeus.md)
- [Connecting to LND via Lightning Node Connect (LNC)](service-guides/lightning/lnc.md) - Lightning Node Connect (LNC) provides a very simple way to connect to an LND node that does not require the Tor network.

## Using LNbits

  - [Connect to LNbits wallets](service-guides/lightning/lnbits.md) â€“ Create and connected to a walled-off wallet in a layer above your lightning network implementation of CLN or LND.
