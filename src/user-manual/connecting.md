## Connecting Locally

When connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as your server, visit your unique `https://<adjective-noun>.local` URL from any browser. Local connections are the fastest possible, no Internet connection required.

## Connecting with a Router VPN

Most modern routers have VPN functionality built-in. Refer to your router's manual for instructions.

## Connecting over Tor

```admonish warning
It is normal for Tor connections to be slow or unreliable at times.
```

You can connect to your server from anywhere in the world, privately and anonymously, by visiting its unique `http://....onion` URL from any Tor-enabled browser.
