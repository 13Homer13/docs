# Using WiFi

StartOS does not have WiFi capabilities.

Servers are intended to be online 24/7, and a direct, Ethernet connection is always faster and more reliable than WiFi.

However, WiFi can sometimes be necessary, such as in a school or office setting where Ethernet connections are not available. In these circumstances, we recommend using a WiFi extender.

You connect the WiFi extender to the available WiFi network, then you connect your StartOS server to the WiFi extender using Ethernet. It is that easy.

The WiFi extenders below have been tested to work with StartOS, but other extenders should also work.
