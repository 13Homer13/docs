# WiFi

```admonish danger title="Not Recommended"
Servers sold by Start9 do _not_ include WiFi cards, and Start9 recommends _against_ using WiFi unless absolutely necessary.

Ethernet connections are faster and more reliable.
```

```admonish danger title="Deprecated"
WiFi support will be removed in StartOS v0.4.1 including for servers that may already have a WiFi interface. If you do not have access to Ethernet, you can use a WiFi extender to connect to the local network, then connect your server to the extender via Ethernet. Please contact Start9 support with any questions or concerns.
