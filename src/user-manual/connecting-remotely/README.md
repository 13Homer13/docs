# Connecting Remotely

There are multiple ways to connect to your server remotely, each with different use cases and tradeoffs.

- [Router VPN](./router-vpn.md). Ideal for fast, _personal_ access from anywhere in the world. Nothing is exposed to the Internet.

- [Clearnet](./clearnet.md). Allows for exposing specific resources to the Internet as standard (`.com`, `.net`, etc) websites and APIs.

- [Tor](./tor.md). Useful for (1) personal access _or_ (2) exposing specific resources to the _private_ Internet (aka the "Darknet") as anonymous (`.onion`) websites and APIs.
