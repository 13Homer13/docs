# Connecting Remotely

There are three ways to connect to your server and its installed services remotely, each with different use cases and tradeoffs.

- [Router VPN](./router-vpn.md). Fast, private, _personal_ access from anywhere in the world using your router's VPN server

<!-- - [Cloud VPN](./cloud-vpn.md). Fast, private, _personal_ access from anywhere in the world using a VPN server running on your VPS. -->

- [Clearnet](./clearnet.md). Permits hosting services on the _public_ Internet using standard (`.com`, `.net`, etc) domains.

- [Tor](./tor.md). Permits hosting services on the _private_ Internet (aka the "Darknet") as anonymous (`.onion`) domains.
