# Connecting Locally

## Use Case

Local connections are the fastest possible, as they do not reach out to the Internet. To connect locally, you must be connected to the same LAN as your server.

## Instructions

1. If you haven't already, assign a static IP address to your server on the LAN. Refer to your router's user manual for detailed instructions.
1. If you haven't already, [Trust your Server's Root CA](./trust-ca.md) on this device.
1. Visit your server's unique `.local` _or_ `IP` address from any browser.
   - Your `.local` address was provided during initial setup.
   - Your `IP` address can be found in your router dashboard.
   - Both addresses are available in your StartOS dashboard under `System > StartOS UI`.
