## Connecting over Router VPN

**Prerequisite**

- [Trusting Your Root CA](./trust-ca.md)

Most modern routers have VPN functionality built-in. Refer to your router's user manual for instructions to complete the following steps.

1. Assign a static IP address to your server.

2. Enable your router's VPN.

   ```admonish tip title="Enable Dynamic DNS (Optional)"

   Rarely, your ISP may unexpectedly change your home IP address. If this happens, it will break your VPN connection until you re-complete the steps below. To prevent this, you can enable Dynamic DNS in your router, which is usually a paid service. To learn more about Dynamic DNS, click [here]().
   ```

3. Download your VPN config file from your router.

4. Install OpenVPN on your client device(s) and establish a VPN connection to your LAN using the config file from above.
