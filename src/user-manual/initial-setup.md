### Use Existing Drive

Select this option if:

1. You have re-flashed StartOS and want to resumt normal operation on the same drive and server.

1. You are physically transplanting your data drive to a new server.

### Transfer

Select this option if you are transferring your data from one drive to another.

### Restore from Backup (Disaster Recovery)

Select this option _only_ if your StartOS data drive has been lost or corrupted. This is for disaster recovery only.
