# Initial Setup

1. Connect your server to power and Ethernet. If you do not have access to Ethernet, click [here](../help/common-issues.md#i-do-not-have-access-to-ethernet). You do *not* need to connect a monitor or keyboard to your server.

1. From a client computer connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as your server, open a browser and visit <a href="http://start.local" target="_blank">http://start.local</a>. This client computer can be a laptop, desktop or mobile device.

### Use Existing Drive

Select this option if:

1. You have re-flashed StartOS and want to resumt normal operation on the same drive and server.

1. You are physically transplanting your data drive to a new server.

### Transfer

Select this option if you are transferring your data from one drive to another.

### Restore from Backup (Disaster Recovery)

Select this option _only_ if your StartOS data drive has been lost or corrupted. This is for disaster recovery only.
